Would you like support for a new mesh format in meshio? First check the existing issues, there are a number of format requests already. It's often easy to get rudimentary support for a format, so don't be afraid to start a PR!

Consider posting in https://github.com/nschloe/meshio/discussions for feedback before raising a feature request.

**Format specification?**

Most formats have a detailed specification somewhere online. Make sure to post a link to that.
