**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
A minimal code example that reproduces the problem would be a big help if you can provide it. Attach a small mesh file if necessary.

I may ask you to cut and paste the output of the following command.
```
pip freeze | grep meshio
```

**Did I help?**
